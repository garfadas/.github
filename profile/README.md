    <h1>Garfada</h1>
    <p>Management system to control meal distribution for industrial restaurants.</p>
</div>

Garfada was thought to substitute the old paper-method for meal registration and help its user to manager its meal distribution, guarantying the identity from whom got, when got, and how many times, being fast to register, easy to use, and a source of truth for who is using and who checks its register.

Its intention is to help you never more have disputes about how many meals was distributed or what dishes was severed in a determined day, saving the time of creating spreadsheet, decrease the queues generated by assignment action, generating reports and eliminate the loose of information, everything with a simple user interface what everyone can easily use.
